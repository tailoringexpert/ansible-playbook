# Contents of this directory

Due to security restrictions on the first target system, it was decided to place all templates to be installed in the
all files to be installed in the _templates_ directory. These files will not be submitted to git.
Therefore, all files in this directory except _README.md_ will be ignored by gitignore.

## Directory structure 

There are two types of files to distinguish:

1. Versioned platform templates
2. Host related templates
